# Processing of the scRNA-seq data from Pellin et al. 2019
* Unzip the raw count files of HSC and MPP, then use the codes in preprocess_PellinData.R to convert the gene symbols to gene ids, and remove the redundant gene ids. Remember to modify the file path accordingly.
* The output files should then be: exprMa_hsc_rmDup_pellin_github.txt and exprMa_mpp_rmDup_pellin_github.txt
